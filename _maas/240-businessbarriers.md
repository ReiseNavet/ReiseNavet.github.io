Business-related aspects are one of the main topics addressed by scientific literature on MaaS.

MaaS is in general a new concept, and the business models are still in development. There are challenges regarding the viability of the business models. In general, the following aspects are discussed:
*	The role of public vs private actors. MaaS may be market driven, public controlled, or a public-private collaboration.
*	Different types of MaaS-providers such as public and private actors, actors building MaaS around their own transport services, and more mode agnostic actors without their own services.
*	Cannibalism with respect to public transport. i.e., that other modes are used instead of public transport
*	How the different roles should be organised, e.g., the data integrator role, and the responsibilities of the roles.
*	The effects of MaaS on different part of the value network, e.g., that more customers for one actor also may imply more customers for others.

Literature studies and interviews with stakeholders that potentially may be a part of the MaaS value network have identified several barriers:
*	Willingness to be a part of MaaS: It is crucial that the transport operators are willing to be a part of MaaS. The transport operators are concerned about losing control, and they may mistrust the intention of the MaaS provider. A transport operator may become less visible and will not have the same opportunities for branding as in a standalone service. It might also be considered as threat that more than one transport service of one type may be offered via MaaS. Transport operators fear for the same consequences as hotels have experienced with the emergence of powerful hotel portals. They suspect the use of unfair algorithms when offers to the end user are made (e.g., that certain transport operators get a priority), and they fear misuse of data and loss of data about the travellers' preferences and demands. In the worst case, MaaS providers may use data to establish their own transport services and start competing with existing transport services.
*	Agreements: Contractual issues are a challenge due to the diversity of transport services and transport operators, and due to the mutual dependencies between the transport services constituting a transport chain. The responsibilities in case of deviations and complaints must be clear. It is also important that the contracts focus on the policy to be followed and the goals to be achieved. It may for example be better to address a reduction of emissions rather than the numbers of journeys to be delivered.
*	Diversity: The diversity of the transport services offered via MaaS affects the business models. Car rental/car sharing services have for example special needs due to the value of the cars and the nature of the service. Users must commit themselves to take economic responsibilities. Additional services like parking, charging/fuelling, extension of hire period, price calculators, etc. may require a deep integration into the MaaS solution. The business models of the transport operators may be business-to-customers (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G) and peer-to-peer (P2P). The MaaS service itself may also be B2C, B2B and B2G.  
*	Price models: Price models affect the behaviour of the travellers, and the price models must be adapted to the overall goals as well as to the available transport services.  Long commitment periods for one transport service may work as a lock-in and prohibit the use of other modes, and mobility packages with a fixed quantity of certain modes may not be fully utilised. The travellers should get what they pay for, and they should not have to pay for services that they do not use. Flexible price models may encourage the use of more modes, and the travellers may find their preferred way of travelling and change their behaviour, e.g., towards more use of active modes and reduce their car ownership.
