The MaaS ecosystem and the provision of MaaS services involve several actors. So far, there are no common definitions of these stakeholders, and the literature operates with different names and different definitions of the actors. 
 
The roles defined in here represent stakeholder archetypes with non-overlapping responsibilities. The roles defined are partly aligned ongoing work in ISO but are more detailed to arrange for modularity and flexibility. 
 
The use of generic, non-overlapping roles arranges for modularity and flexibility. The roles and the responsibilities represented by the roles can be fulfilled by different actors in the real world. One real actor may have one or more roles, and there may be several actors with the same role. Some examples :
- An actor with the MaaS Provider role may also have the Transport Service Provider role. This is for example the case if a public transport provider is a MaaS provider. 
- Several actors may be MaaS Providers. They may cover different modes, areas, and regions, but the modes and geographical areas they cover may also partly or fully overlap.
- An actor with the MaaS Provider role may also be a MaaS Data integrator. This is the case if the actor collects and integrates data from one or more Transport Service Providers. 
- Several actors may be MaaS Data Integrators, but there may also be just one, e.g. at a national level. 
-	Several actors may be MaaS Facilitators, and they may provide different types of solutions and services to MaaS Providers. A MaaS Facilitator may be a commercial service provider or a national entity providing national services, e.g. a national travel planner.
-	An actor with the MaaS Provider role may also be a MaaS Facilitator if the actor develops its own solutions (travel planner, payment solutions, etc.). 
-	One actor may be both a MaaS Data Integrator and a MaaS Facilitator. Such actors may for example provide one or more generic services based on collected data.
