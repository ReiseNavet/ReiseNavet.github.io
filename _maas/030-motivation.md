For the stakeholders, different driver motivates for a change towards a participation in the MaaS ecosystem. Below we provide for the main stakeholder roles an overview of the main driver groups and drivers with assessments of the the current situation. Based on this we provide golas to be reasched for a sucessful implementation of MaaS.

## Customer/Traveller

### Customer/Traveller drivers with assessments
Economic sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Cost reduction due to no need for private car:** Today it is expensive to be a car owner (purchase, engine, parking, insurance, taxes, etc.). In cities, there are also other types of cost, e.g. time use and trouble related to parking of the car.
- **Ability to avoid "lock-in" product.** Not just public transport but a good price on a variety of modes: Flexibility is expensive if you do not have a car. When you pay for one product, e.g. public transport, you may be "locked-in" with that product for a period. If you want to use other products and modes in addition (e.g. car rental and micro mobility), you have to pay extra.

Usability drivers with assessments:
- **Ability to easily find, book and pay for a variety of transport service options depending on needs:** Today, Travellers have to use a variety of Apps when they travel across countries, regions and cities. For many it is a barrier to find and use new travel options. Thus, they use the options they already know about, even though there might be better alternatives. It may not be easy to find the best option, and if they find new options, the Travellers must know how to pay, and perhaps also download and use new Apps. Trials may however contribute to a behavioural change towards use of MaaS.
- **Ability to get support for easy and flexible mobility:** When the use of several modes is required, and when they travel long distances, Travellers quite often have to search for, plan, book and pay for the individual legs of the journey. Some travel planners are multimodal and advanced, but new modes and modes like car sharing may not be included, and payment may not be supported for all modes. Deviations in one leg of a journey, may put extra burdens on the Travellers. They may have to figure out the consequences for the total journey, and when the possibility to reach succeeding legs is affected, Traveller may have to find alternative routes or new departures, and handle related tasks (cancellations, re-booking, payments, etc.). 

Environmental sustainability drivers with assessments:
-	**Being green and a green image desired:** Many people wish to cope without their own car. They may for example be concerned about the environment, they may a car is too expensive, or they may think that it is trendy to not have a car. Despite of this, they need or think they need the flexibility provided by a car and do not realise that there are options that may work. Trials do however show that MaaS may reduce the use of private car. 

Data access drivers with assessments:
- Private data must be protected and not misused: Today, data is shared with individual Transport Service Providers via their Apps. In addition, data is also extensively shared with providers of social media and actors like Google, and these actors have probably a good overview of the mobility patterns.

### Traveller/Customer goals and requirements
From the above we derive the following goals to be reached to ensure an acceptace of MaaS anong Travellers/Customers:
- One App supports all journeys
- Less need for manual (re-)planning
- More seamless integration between transport services
- Simplified deviation handling
- Easier to buy cheapest combination of the needed transport services
- Cheaper to use MaaS than to use private cars
- More available and flexible transport alternatives
- Protection of private data

## MaaS Provider

### MaaS Provider drivers with assessments
Economic sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Commercial actors need return of investment and cost coverage:** For commercial MaaS Providers, it has been a challenge to find viable business models. The Travellers' willingness to pay has not to a sufficient extend ensured sufficient return of investment and cost coverage. Public MaaS Providers aim to fulfil transport political goals, e.g. goals regarding the urban environment. 
- **Ability to reach new customer groups:** MaaS providers that also provide transport services, see opportunities in extending their own service, e.g. with services for first/last mile. Commercial MaaS providers not providing own transport services, see business opportunities in integrated services for Travellers.
- **Ability to re-sell products provided by others:** Some countries, e.g. Finland, has already deregulated ticket sales, and public Transport Service Providers are obliged to open for re-sales of a minimum set of products. Other countries have hybrid solutions where products are sold via a central unit, and MaaS Providers must have agreements with the central unit to be able to re-sell products. A European deregulations of ticket sales is planned.

Social sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Public actors aims for a fulfilment of transport policies:** It is a concern that commercial MaaS providers mainly may focus on economic gains and have less focus on environmental and social sustainability.
- **Ability to support mobility for all and in all areas:** A MaaS with a diversity of transport options offers flexibility to the Travellers. This may be beneficial to the society and the environment as it reduces the need for private cars. The establishment of such an ecosystem is however a challenge.
- **Ability to bridge transport silos:** Public transport and new modes may be regulated at different levels. Political and regulatory issues regarding transport services vary between countries, and MaaS providers have to adapt. Public transport may for example be managed at a regional level while micro mobility mainly is managed by cities/municipalities.  

Environmental sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Reach customers through green service offerings:** Many people wish to cbe green, and trials show that MaaS services with a diversity of transport options offers flexibility and may reduce the need for private cars. MaaS has however so far not succeeded with respect to this at a large scale.

Implementation feasibility drivers with assessments:
- **Manageable to implement viable business models:** More knowledge is needed regarding business models and the effect of the comming reregulation of ticket sales.
- **Manageable to build the competence needed:** The implementation of good MaaS services requires knowledge and skills. The integration of on-demand transport is not straight forward; it is challenging to support one payment for all transport services used; and it is challenging to meet political goals, and to convince citizens about that they do not need private cars. The MaaS community may benefit from more collaboration and knowledge sharing through both formal and informal networking activities
- **Manageable to develop and offer attractive and federated services:** Today, MaaS Providers cover a specific area or a limited set of transport services. The MaaS App cannot be used for other areas or other transport services in general. A federated Maas will require access to standardised data across cities, regions and countries. Data on on-demand transport are today not commonly shared. The access to data is not sufficiently harmonised across regions and countries, and contractual issues are too demanding when they must be negotiated with and customized to different Transport Service Providers.

Data access drivers with assessments:
- **Ability to access and use relevant data of sufficient amount, type and quality, suitable for MaaS:** MaaS Providetrs need access to data. The data sharing has traditionally targeted public transport. Transport Service Providers providing commercial on-demand services are to a little degree sharing data today. 
- **Willingness to share data:** Some Transport Service Providers are not willing to share data due to a lack of trust regarding how the data can be used. They fear among others exposure of business secrets, misuse of data(e.g. that competing transport services are established based on insight provided by the data), and unfair assignment of tours (e.g. that the MaaS Provider will prioritise use of their own transport services or greener modes). Transport Service Providers in traditional modes (e.g. taxi) are more reluctant to join MaaS than Transport Service Providers in new modes (e.g. micro mobility). Usually, MaaS ecosystems do not include competing Transport Service Providers. There is for example just one provider of city bikes, one provider of e-scooters, etc.  

Public image drivers with assessments::
- **Ability to maintain an image that gnerate more customers:** Travellers need the flexibility provided by private cars.  Thus, MaaS Providers should combine different types of services. This is not the case for most MaaS-solutions today, and the solutions do not in general support one payment for all transport services.  More knowledge is also needed on the price models to use. 
- **Ability to offer green and trendy service:** In general, MaaS is considered as beneficial to both the society and the environment. Thus, MaaS Providers will have a good public image as long as they deliver what they promise. 
- **Ability to measure and show effects of MaaS:**  Some reseach projects have shown the potential of MaaS, but not in a large scale.
- **To be trustworthy, fair and transparent:** The willingness to share data is not haigh for some traditional modes (see above)

### MaaS Povider goals and requirements
From the above we derive the following goals to be reached to ensure sucessful MaaS Providers:
- More viable and fair business models
- More knowledge sharing on MaaS
- Easier to establish MaaS, federated MaaS included 
- Easy and efficient access to data from all types of transport services
- Easy to identify and integrate attractive transport services
- More customers
- Easy and efficient access to data from all types of transport services
- More available and more flexible transport alternatives
- MaaS can replace private cars
- Offer cheapest combination of the needed transport services
- Be a trusted MaaS provider
