For the stakeholders, different driver motivates for a change towards a participation in the MaaS ecosystem. Below we provide for the main stakeholder roles an overview of the main driver groups and drivers with assessments of the the current situation. Based on this we provide golas to be reasched for a sucessful implementation of MaaS.

## Customer/Traveller

### Customer/Traveller drivers with assessments
Economic sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Cost reduction due to no need for private car:** Today it is expensive to be a car owner (purchase, energy, parking, insurance, taxes, etc.). In cities, there are also other types of cost, e.g. time use and trouble related to parking of the car.
- **Ability to avoid "lock-in" product.** They need a good price on a variety of modes, but flexibility is expensive. When you pay for one product, e.g. public transport, you may be "locked-in" with that product for a period. If you want to use other products and modes in addition (e.g. car rental and micro mobility), you have to pay extra.

Usability drivers with assessments:
- **Ability to easily find, book and pay for a variety of transport service options depending on needs:** Today, Travellers have to use a variety of Apps when they use differerent transport services and when they travel across countries, regions and cities. For many it is a barrier to find and use new travel options, and they use the options they already know about, even though there might be better alternatives. It may not be easy to find the best option, and if they find new options, the Travellers must know how to pay, and perhaps also download and use new Apps.
- **Ability to get support for easy and flexible mobility:** When the use of several modes is required, and when they travel long distances, Travellers quite often have to search for, plan, book and pay for the individual legs of the journey. Some travel planners are multimodal and advanced, but new modes and modes like car sharing may not be included, and payment may not be supported for all modes. Deviations in one leg of a journey put extra burdens on the Travellers. They have to figure out the consequences for the total journey, and when succeeding legs are affected, Travellers have to find alternative routes or new departures, and handle related tasks (cancellations, re-booking, payments, etc.). 

Environmental sustainability drivers with assessments:
-	**Being green and a green image are desired:** Many people wish to cope without a private car. They may for example be concerned about the environment, think that carhold is too expensive, or that it is trendy to not have a car. However, they need the flexibility provided by a car and do not realise that other options may work. Trials do however show that MaaS may reduce the use of private car. 

Data access drivers with assessments:
- **Private data must be protected**: Today, data is shared with individual Transport Service Providers via their Apps. In addition, data is also extensively shared with providers of social media and actors like Google, and these actors have probably a good overview of the mobility patterns.

### Traveller/Customer goals
From the above we derive the following goals to be reached to ensure an acceptace of MaaS anong Travellers/Customers:
- One App supports all journeys
- More available and flexible transport alternatives
- More seamless integration between transport services
- Easier to buy cheapest combination of the needed transport services
- Cheaper to use MaaS than to use private cars
- Simplified deviation handling
- Less need for manual (re-)planning
- Protection of private data

## MaaS Provider

### MaaS Provider drivers with assessments
Economic sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Commercial actors need return of investment and cost coverage:** For commercial MaaS Providers, it has been a challenge to find viable business models. The Travellers' willingness to pay has not to a sufficient extend ensured sufficient return of investment and cost coverage.  
- **Ability to reach new customer groups:** MaaS providers that also provide transport services, see opportunities in extending their own service, e.g. with services for first/last mile. Commercial MaaS providers not providing own transport services, see business opportunities in integrated services for Travellers.
- **Ability to re-sell products provided by others:** Some countries, e.g. Finland, have already deregulated ticket sales, and public Transport Service Providers are obliged to open for re-sales of a minimum set of products. Other countries have hybrid solutions where products are sold via a central unit. A European deregulations of ticket sales is planned.

Social sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Public actors aims for a fulfilment of transport policies:** Public MaaS Providers aim to fulfil goals regarding the urban environment. It is a concern that commercial MaaS providers mainly may focus on economic gains and have less focus on environmental and social sustainability.
- **Ability to support mobility for all and in all areas:** A MaaS service with a diversity of transport options offers flexibility to the Travellers. This may be beneficial to the society and the environment as it reduces the need for private cars. The establishment of such an ecosystem is however a challenge.
- **Ability to bridge transport silos:** Public transport and new modes may be regulated at different levels. Public transport may for example be managed at a regional level while micro mobility mainly is managed by cities/municipalities. Political and regulatory issues regarding transport services vary between countries, and MaaS providers have to adapt.   

Environmental sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Reach customers through green service offerings:** Many people wish to be green, and trials show that MaaS services with a diversity of transport options offers flexibility and may reduce the need for private cars. MaaS has however so far not succeeded with respect to this in a large scale.

Implementation feasibility drivers with assessments:
- **Manageable to implement viable business models:** Today, MaaS business models are a huge challenge. More knowledge is needed regarding business models, also regarding the effect of the comming reregulation of ticket sales.
- **Manageable to build the competence needed:** The implementation of good MaaS services requires knowledge. The integration of on-demand transport is not straight forward; it is among others challenging to support one payment for all transport services used; and it is challenging to meet political goals and to convince citizens about that they do not need private cars. The MaaS community may benefit from more collaboration and knowledge sharing through both formal and informal networking activities
- **Manageable to develop and offer attractive and federated services:** Today, MaaS Providers cover a specific area or a limited set of transport services. The MaaS App cannot be used across areas and transport services. A federated Maas will require access to standardised data across cities, regions and countries. Data on on-demand transport are today not commonly shared. The access to data is not sufficiently harmonised across regions and countries, and contractual issues are too demanding when they must be negotiated with and customized to different Transport Service Providers.

Data access drivers with assessments:
- **Ability to access and use relevant data of sufficient amount, type and quality, suitable for MaaS:** MaaS Providetrs need access to data. The data sharing has traditionally targeted public transport. Transport Service Providers providing commercial on-demand services are to a little degree sharing data today. 
- **Willingness to share data:** Some Transport Service Providers are not willing to share data due to a lack of trust regarding how the data can be used. They fear among others exposure of business secrets, misuse of data (e.g. that competing transport services are established based on insight provided by the data), and unfair assignment of tours (e.g. that the MaaS Provider will prioritise use of their own transport services or greener modes). Transport Service Providers in traditional modes (e.g. taxi) are more reluctant to join MaaS than Transport Service Providers in new modes (e.g. micro mobility). Usually, MaaS ecosystems do not include competing Transport Service Providers. There is for example just one provider of city bikes, one provider of e-scooters, etc.  

Public image drivers with assessments::
- **Ability to maintain an image that gnerate more customers:** Travellers need the flexibility provided by private cars.  Thus, MaaS Providers should combine different types of services. This is not the case for most MaaS-solutions today, and the solutions do not in general support one payment for all transport services.  More knowledge is also needed on the price models to use. 
- **Ability to offer green and trendy service:** In general, MaaS is considered as beneficial to both the society and the environment. Thus, MaaS Providers will have a good public image as long as they deliver what they promise. 
- **Ability to measure and show effects of MaaS:**  Some reseach projects have shown the potential of MaaS, but not in a large scale.
- **To be trustworthy, fair and transparent:** The willingness to share data is not haigh for some traditional modes (see above)

### MaaS Povider goals
From the above we derive the following goals to be reached to ensure sucessful MaaS Providers:
- More viable and fair business models
- More knowledge sharing on MaaS
- Easier to establish MaaS, federated MaaS included 
- Easy to identify and integrate attractive transport services
- Easy and efficient access to data from all types of transport services
- More customers
- Easy and efficient access to data from all types of transport services
- More available and more flexible transport alternatives
- MaaS services replace private cars
- Offer cheapest combination of the needed transport services
- Be a trusted MaaS provider

## Transport Sevice Provider
### Transport Sevice Provider drivers with assessments
Economic sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Profitability:**  The business models must ensure sufficient return of investment and cost coverage.
- **Ability to reach bigger markets and new customer groups:** Transport Service Provider may experience more competition if not in MaaS, especially if the MaaS  service includes transport services that are in direct competition with their own services. Thus, Transport Service Providers, especially those representing new modes, may see MaaS as a business opportunity. In combination with other transport services they may reach new customers, e.g. by providing first/last mile services. They may also become more visible as a contributor to sustainable transport.
- **Cost-efficiently integration into several MaaS:** The integration into MaaS may put extra costs on the Transport Service Provider. They have to implement the required data sharing, and they have to negotiate and enter contracts with the MaaS Providers and/or public entities (e.g. city/municipality). If they will integrate into several MaaS ecosystems, it is beneficial if they can share data in a similar way for all. 

Social and environmental sustainability drivers with assessments:
- **Ability to be a part of something "bigger" than own services:** Transport Service Providers, especially those representing new modes, may see that they in combination with other transport services they may reach new customers and also become more visible as a contributor to sustainable transport.

Implementation feasibility drivers with assessments:
- **Manageable to implement digital integration into MaaS:** Data og scheduled transport services can be shared via existing platforms. Some countries, e.g. Nowray, also have national platforms supporting micromobility and on-demand transport. The sharing of data via national or commonly used platforms is beneficial. Data can be shared once and used by "all" MaaS Providers.

Data access drivers with assessments:
- **Ability to trust fairness :** Some Transport Service Providers have concerns about data sharing, but due to regulations many have to share their data. Among those that do not share data today, e.g. many providers of traditional on-demand services like taxi, there is a fear that the data sharing may expose business secrets and reduce the competitional power, and they fair that the MaaS Provider will prioritise their own services or services provided by other higher. 
- **Ability to get data on use of service:** By joining MaaS, the distance to the users might become longer, and some Transport Service Providers fear less direct contact with the users (Travellers), and thus reduced access to data on user needs, market opportunities, and changes in trends. This might reduce their capability for adaptation to new possibilities and trends.

Public image drivers with assessments:
- **Remain visible:** By entering MaaS, the visibility of the brands of the Transport Service Providers might be reduced. The Travellers will know the MaaS Provider and be less informed about the Transport Service Providers. 
- **Ability to be a part of popular/trendy mobility services:** By joining MaaS, Transport Service Providers may be a part of something bigger and be recognised as a contrinutor to sustainable transport.

### Transport Service Povider goals
From the above we derive the following goals to be reached to ensure sucessful Transport Service Providers:
- Less costly to integrate in MaaS
- Easier to integrate with MaaS
- Ability to do branding through MaaS
- Increased profit through MaaS
- More transparent and trustworthy MaaS Providers
- More data supporting service development
