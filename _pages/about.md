ReiseNavet is an innovation project funded by the [Transport 2025](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/about-the-research-council/programmes/transport/) program of the [Norwegian Research Council](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/). The project started June 1st 2019 and will end May 31st 2022.

The topic of ReiseNavet is Mobility as a Service (MaaS). MaaS offers digital support to door-to-door journeys via one single interface. Different transport services can be combined, and there is only one payment. It should be possible to buy both "pay-as-you-go" tickets and mobility packages that combine different transport services. The intention is to facilitate and encourage a change in behaviour towards more sustainable mobility and to reduce the need for private car ownership.

The project partners are [Entur](https://om.entur.no/bedrift/om-entur/), [SINTEF](https://www.sintef.no/en/), [Ruter](https://ruter.no/en/about-ruter/about-us/), [Kolombus](https://www.kolumbus.no/en/about-kolumbus/about-the-company/), [Hertz](https://www.hertz.no/rentacar/reservation/), [Hyre](https://www.hyre.no/) and [Urban Sharing](https://urbansharing.com/).

## Objective

The main objective of ReiseNavet is to provide knowledge on how a nationwide and digital MaaS platform efficiently and flexibly can support the realisation of MaaS. The project will explore possible platform capabilities regarding data integration and supporting services to MaaS providers and transport operators. 

Date integration for "all modes" (public transport, city bikes, taxis, car sharing, car rental, etc. ) will be supported. By using the platform, MaaS providers can avoid demanding digital integration with transport operators and focus on the end user support (Apps for travel planning and assistance, mobility package designs, price models, ticketing, etc.). By sharing their data with the platform, transport operators can more easily be integrated in several MaaS-services. The platform will publish the data as open data that can be used as a basis for novel services.

Services supporting the interaction between MaaS providers and transport operators will be addressed. Such services may simplify the establishment of MaaS. The role of the platform will be investigated, among others how a semantic model for MaaS can support the definition of mobility packages, as well as route planning and orchestration of door-to-door journey, and associated bookings.Project activities and results (links to wiki when relevant)
